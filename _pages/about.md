I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Oxford, specialising in public opinion and political behaviour in democracies, using quantitative methods. I usually focus on questions of political identity, but also study climate opinions and attitudes towards the EU. Occasionally I teach classes and lecture undergraduate politics here at Oxford.

I've been a visiting fellow at Harvard University and have worked for the BBC as a political analyst. Before Oxford, I completed an MSc in Comparative Government at the London School of Economics. I've also worked in research and related roles for Labour Members of Parliament in the UK, and for local government.
