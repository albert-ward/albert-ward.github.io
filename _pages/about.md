I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Oxford, specialising in public opinion and political behaviour in democracies, using quantitative methods. I usually focus on questions of political identity, but also study climate opinions and attitudes towards the EU. Occasionally I teach classes and lecture undergraduate politics here at Oxford.
